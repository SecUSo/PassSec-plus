## Important Note

We have adapted the functionality/logic and the user interfaces of PassSec+ to be inline with those of TORPEDO. This is part of our activities in the Helmholtz topic Engineering Secure Systems. Since we no longer classify an Extended Validation Certificate as low risk (analogous to the decision of the web browser), this means that some pages (especially from banks) are no longer included directly as low risk, but as unknown risk.
